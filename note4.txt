you early  work with branch  although not make  a branch  but  on a master branch
✅git work on branchig
in git we are alwayse working on a branch the defult name is ✅master  📌its just like any other branch
some people  master branch as  offical branch no mess     you can delete you can rename it 
master ?  main ?    in 2020 ✅ github renamed the deafult branch from master to main   but the default git branch is  still master 
▶most company main as  main copy branch

Head - > master head arrow master    what this thing
4----
head a pointer that refers to current location in your reposetory     head  to a particular branch refs
head always points to latst commit you made on the master branch✅ 
think about branch as  bookmark in a book    same  time  a bookmark open  of this book   
 this examp that its  actully open to the bookmark  so that  is what head refers to head is our current location 
head s refence to a branch pointer  branch pointer is where a branch currently is  its like thats bookmark in a book
we  can have whole bunch of branches and each one has a branch reference that just referto where that branch is 
each branch has a branch reference pointing to where we left off
head  refre  to last commit✅✅✅

5----
git branch   show  list branch   *   star    on branch active
6---
git branch name  create branch
git switch  name branch     actve  on name branch
7---
✅git commit -a -m  "  "     one line   add and commit
when git on each branch    you create branch   this branch again tree    🌿
8----
git checkout     it still exist in git  it does a lot more than just switching branch 
it just kind of  knif  swiss
git switch -c  c stand for create   name branch  shortcut switch branch and create
9---
if  switch branch  and  not commited change  on current commit or stashed    git erro   first  distict change on current branch then switch another branch
sometime you have unstaged changed they will come with you✅ other time if they  re in conflict git yell at you❌❌
10---
we have any where delete branch but not be on branch   git branch -d name   -D  capital   equivalent  --force
rename   but  have to on branch  and cant frequently rename  branch    ✅git branch -m new name   m -> move
