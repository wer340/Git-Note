global config file
if you have multiple user account on machine that asystem wide config file would apply all of the user
▶git config --global user.name

i like to see  all of my aliases at once so we can actually open up config file   where look  for that?
git folder > ~/.gitconfig  or ~/.config/git/config 
c>user/my_name_pc/.gitconfig or

we can easily set up git aaliases to make our git experience a bit simpler and faster
for example  we could define an alias ▶git ci  instaed of having to type ▶git commit  

in config file   indent important 
[alias]
s=status 
l=log
command line 
▶git config --global alias.showmebranch branch result ✔▶▶▶git showmebranch
not use ! exclamition in terminal
cm=commit -m

a =add file1 file2      
▶git add readme.md  package.json
