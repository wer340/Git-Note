   couple of thing confusing
boil it down (brif) to these two principal
✅we merge branches not specific commits so we dont pick one  commit and a second commit and join them together we merge branches
✅we always merge based on current head branch  we merge to where we are   to where head is  and merge  a merged branch is into master branch  not ever  branch is on every where

this name  fast forward merge  because thats all we had to do for this branch to catch up  
✅no additional work on maaster branch   and just one of them  of branch   have  additional commit  say fast  forward branch

when merge   main tree  have all  history commit   own branch+merged branch
3----
git branch -v   little bit more information   last commit + message name  commit
then  git log   see  whether   fast forward merge  caan be   or not ?   
  ✅---✅---✅  
       	 /
         ✅---✅---✅
after merge  branch not deleted   this is  a sepaarate branch  and  continue  new  exprement on branch
4---
git craken   click on name branch  on tool menu  and  switch another branch

5---
something  called a merge  commit  is generated  just makes  a  commit for us on branch that
we are merging into  the recipient branch 

commit can have multiple parent and in fact they do whenever we make a merged commit 
this type  of commit that  both  main tree aand  other tree  have new commit 
if  commit  relate  same file   is good   and  not complicated 
✅example   x branch work on css   y branch on php  two diffrent file
git was able to figure out  oh  just merge in that new stuff into the actual file same 

6---
when you encounter a merge conflict Git   warns you in the console that it could not automatically merge 
it ✅also changes the contents of your  files to indicate the conflicts that it wants you to resolve 
for resolve conflict

1-open up file  with merge conflict
2-edit the files to remove the conflict  decide branchs content you want to keep in each conflict .or keep the content from both
3-remove the conflict markers in the document 
4-add your changes and then make a commit
7---
narrow  down   problem   to  little files aand  little line
when  run  git  merge name    then error     git put branch on maain branch   only want you manualy same file  chage  and commit 

8---
git checkout -b name   = git branch -c name
